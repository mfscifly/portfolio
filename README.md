## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Used a responsive design approach to ensure the website looks great across a variety of devices and screen sizes.

## Optimizations:

Reduced loading times by minimizing the number of, and size of, images. Improved efficiency by focusing on what is important, rather than putting everything I've created on the website.

## Lessons Learned:

Using flexbox and animations appropriately. How to work with various CSS classes. Optimizing images for load speed. Clean design and visual storytelling.
